Hello user,

Compiling this project should be rather easy as it only requires you have java installed. In case you need it the github link to this project is "https://github.com/ToloTom/Comp-490-Senior-Seminar.git".

I am unsure which version(s) are necessary to run this file without any errors, however, I am running this file with java version "16.0.1". 

Now that you are in my GitHub repo, either pull, copy, or download the MagicSquares.java file from the main branch (as this is the most updated version), into whichever IDE you prefer to use.

The particular IDE I used for this project is Visual Studio Code version 1.62.3 with a couple of installed extensions to get java running in VS code. 

Those extensions include: Spring Initializr Java Support v0.8.0 and Extension Pack for Java v0.19.0, which includes: Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat v1.1.0, Debugger for Java v0.37.0, Test Runner for Java v0.33.0,

Maven for Java v0.34.1, Project Manager for Java v0.18.8, and Visiual Stidio IntelliCode v1.2.15.  

To get the desired magic square(s), change the integer input value of the constructMagicSquares() method (inside the main method) and run the program. 

Note that the algorithm will only work for n = 2, n = 3 and n = 4 and will find partial magic squares for any n > 4 (assuming that the algorithm finishes on your device). 

It should take a couple milliseconds for the n = 3 case and a couple seconds for the n = 4 case to produce all magic squares of each respective size. (What once took mathematicians months if not years to write down now only takes you a couple of seconds). 

If you try any n > 4 you will most likely end up with a java heap/out of memory error. 

Hope it was easy to download and compile and that you enjoyed seeing your computer do some amazing calculations.
